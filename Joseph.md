Watch king Of Dreams and wanted to learn more about 
Joseph's bible story.


Genesis 37

Joseph was Isreal's (Jacobs') favorite child 
because he was the child of his old age (vejes?)

His brothers loathed him for it. 

Jacob had a dream were everone kneeled down to him.

Interesting his father kind of questions him about it. 

Of course this also pushes his brothers to the breaking point
of action.

It also shows how Jacob mourned. 
And the text explicitly says Jacob, not Isreal when drescribing thing.
? I Wonder if there's a significants to that.



38


Geneology
- Judah x Shua
    - Er (m)
        - Whicked in God's eyes
        - Yahweh killed him (specifically using God's true name.)
    - Onan (m)
        - Didn't want to conceive with his brother's wife
        - He knew the seed wouldn't be his?
            ? I don't understand. Is he concerned that
            the child he created wouldn't be his own?
                - As in, she own the child and he wouldn't 
                be considered a father?
                - Or that somehow, his brother already impregated her
                and he didn't want to mix with that?
        - Specifically states he spilled his seed on the ground
        - God killed him too for doing that
            ? Honestly, I don't understand how that was evil?
            Was it that he has sex with her not with the intention 
            of giving her a child? Or I guess, sex without the 
            intention of procreation?
            I'm a bit perplexed by this.
    - Shelah(m) (birth place: Chezib)



Okay, verse 12 is perplexing. 

The passage says Judah maried Shua. 

Then it says Judah's wife, the MOTHER OF SHUA, dies.

So, the only to explain this is that Shua's mother has the same 
name as her. Which is why they say, the daughter of Shua.
But that is so weird because they never make mention of it previously,
right? 

? I need to go back and read this.

Judah tells Tamar to wait for his son to get older.
Until then, wear a widows outfit and stay with your father.

Judah's wife dies, and he goes to mourn.

Tamar take to oppurtunity to try and lay with 
his Son since he's older and hasn't been given to him as a wife yet.

She dresses like a prostitu, Judah thinks she's one (and doesn't 
recognize her)
