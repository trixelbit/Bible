Current Throughts :

    Nemehiah is a great noble character. He kind of reminds me of Aragorn.
    Unlike other leaders in the bible, we get a glimps of his leadership
    in practice, like him encouraging and inspiring the men of Israel 
    to fight and protect their families.

    This is told from his perspective though to my understanding.
    In contrast to David, another great leader who's feats 
    are told through Samual, where as what he writes describes
    his highs, lows, and relationship with God through Psalms.





Chapter Breakdowns:
    
    Chapter1:

        Family:
             Hacaliah -> Nehemiah
                     \-> Hanani

        When: 
            Month - Chislev
            Year - 20th

        Nehemiah's brother (among with men from Judah) come and inform
        him that the people in Jerusalem are oppressed, and that their
        walls are broken and gates burned.

        Nehemiah sat down, wept, mourned for days.
        He fasted prayed to God asking 

        He confesses not only the sins of his people but of him a
        and his father.

        Nehemiah points out how God told Moses he will scatter his 
        people if they are Disobediant, but he will regather them 
        each of them back to him if they turn from their ways, seek 
        him, and keep his Commandments.

        Nehemiah pleads for God intervention.

        Chapter conclude with Nehemiah being a cup bearer.


    Chapter 2:
        When: 
            Month - Nisan
            Year - 20th of Artexerxes.

        He served the King, and king saw that Nehemiah was sad
        (which was the first time he saw this way).

        The king asks what he could do for him.
        
        Nehemiah requests that he be sent to Judah so he can rebuild it.

        The King asked how long this would take and when he would return.

        Nehemiah gave a time (though the text never specifies it)
        and he also requests letters:
            
            A letter to Governers across the river so me leave and return
            after his work in Judah.

            A letter to Asaph the keeper of the King's forest to get 
            timber for beams for the gates of the citadel (by the temple)
            and for house ( I assumed for Nehemiah since it's a house he 
            shall "enter into")

            ! This I think is pretty nuts. Not only did the king
            provided his servant extended leave but also 
            gave him large amounts of wood for the resources. 
            It also seems like he gave him guards and potentially
            more. 
            ? I should learn more abou what a "cup bearer" is.  
            Learn about it's role and responsibility during 
            nehemiah's time.
        

        The king accepted this thanks to God's favor over him.

        The king also sent captains of the army and horsemen with 
        Nehemiah.

        Sanballet (Horonite) and Tobiah (Ammonite servant) where 
        grieved by the fact someone wanted to help the people
        of Israel.

        # Wall inspection 
        Nehemiah was in Israel for 3days.
        He then left at night with others to look at the wall.
        He kept his intentions secrete during this.

        Path:
            Valley Gate -> Jackal Well & Dung Gate (Destroyed by fire)
            -> Fountain Gate & King's Pool (was too small with mount)
            -> Valley Gate

        He told nothing to the officials about why he was here or 
        what he was doing.
        
        Nehemiah proclaims the state of the walls and gates,
        that they should rebuild to longer be disgraced (why?), 
        and that the king permitted him to.

        Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem mocked his attempt to 
        rebuld the walls and frames it as him opposing the king.

        Nehemiah retorts by saying God will provided his people
        success, they will rebuild, and that those 3 have no part
        in it. 

        (interesting that that specify historic rights)
        ? Should investigate original translation to get context 

    Chapter 3
        
       Eliashib (high priest) and his priests begin rebuilding the
       Sheep Gate.
