    Nemehiah is a great noble character. He kind of reminds me of Aragon.
    Unlike other leaders in the bible, we get a glimps of his leadership
    in practice, like him encouraging and inspiring the men of Israel 
    to fight and protect their families.

    This is told from his perspective thought to my understanding.





Chapter Breakdowns:
    
    Chapter1:

        Family:
             Hacaliah -> Nehemiah
                     \-> Hanani

        When: 
            Month - Chislev
            Year - 20th

        Nehemiah's brother (among with men from Judah) come and inform
        him that the people in Jerusalem are oppressed, and that their
        walls are broken and gates burned.

        Nehemiah sat down, wept, mourned for days.
        He fasted prayed to God asking 

        He confesses not only the sins of his people but of him a
        and his father.

        Nehemiah points out how God told Moses he will scatter his 
        people if they are Disobediant, but he will regather them 
        each of them back to him if they turn from their ways, seek 
        him, and keep his Commandments.

        Nehemiah pleads for God intervention.

        Chapter conclude with Nehemiah being a cup bearer.


    Chapter 2:
        When: 
            Month - Nisan
            Year - 20th of Artexerxes.

        He served the King, and king saw that Nehemiah was sad
        (which was the first time he saw this way).

        The king asks what he could do for him.
        
        Nehemiah requests that he be sent to Judah so he can rebuild it.

        The King asked how long this would take and when he would return.

        Nehemiah gave a time (though the text never specifies it)
        and he also requests letters:
            
            A letter to Governers across the river so me leave and return
            after his work in Judah.

            A letter to Asaph the keeper of the King's forest to get 
            timber for beams for the gates of the citadel (by the temple)
            and for house ( I assumed for Nehemiah since it's a house he 
            shall "enter into")

        The king accepted this thanks to God's favor over him.

        The king also sent captains of the army and horsemen with 
        Nehemiah.

        Sanballet (Horonite) and Tobiah (Ammonite servant) where 
        grieved by the fact someone wanted to help the people
        of Israel.

        Nehemiah was in Israel for 3days.
