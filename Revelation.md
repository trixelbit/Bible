# Goals 
I'm planning to have an expedition through Revelation. 
This will include writing a brief summary of contents as I go
and the addition of notes, analysis, and references this makes.

This was sparked by an increasing number of conversations about 
Christianity and my beliefs as a result of this election.

I seem to find my self more and more in this position, whether at work,
online, or my personal life. 

Even if this dies down, I don't want to be missinformed on my faith,
nor do I want to give into meekness out of fear of spreading misinformation.


2 Corinthians 5:20 we are called to be ambassadors of Christ. 
Ephesians 6:11 tells us to put on the armor of God. In this case,
I seek to strengthen the sword of the spirit and God's word.

1 Question I do want to have answered is if this contains a prophecy 
about a 1 world government or 1 world religion.

The was a quesetion that I was ill equipt to answer.



# Expedition

Chapter 1:

1-2: This book describes prophecy that must come to pass. 
God sent an angel to reveal this to a servant of God.

3: Promise of blessing to all who read this prohpesy or book.

4-6: A greeting describing who this is for and and who sent it. 
To: 7 assmeblies in Asia.
From: 
    - God 
        (describes him as who 
        he was, 
        is, 
        and will be: reference to original name)
    - 7 spirits before the throne 
        ? Who are they? Are they like entities of the holy spirit)
        # Okay, after finishing chapter 1, it seems they are the angles
          of those assmeblies.
    - Jesus Christ 
        - The Witness
        - First born from the dead
            - implying more to come
        - Ruler of the kings of the earth.
        - who Loves us
        - Washed our sin with his blood.
The Messanger: John (Apostle John?)

7-11:

John was on the island of Patmos.
He was in the spirit when he heard a voice telling explicitly 
to write what he saw and send it to: 
 - Ephesus
 - Smyrna
 - Pergamum
 - Thyatira
 - Sardis
 - Philadelphia
 - Laodicea

 He also describes the voice as loud like a trumpet.
 This trumpet imagery comes up more later so I'm notaing it here.


12: Imagary descibed: 

7-16 golden lampstands

Lamp stand 1:
    Was like the "Son Of Man"(Assuming he looks like Jesus
    or IS Jesus)

    - Robes down to feet
    - Golden Sash around chest
    - Head and hair is white like wool/snow
    - Eyes: were like fire.
    - Feet: were like Burnished Brass (need to look up) 
        like refined in furnace.
    - Voice: Many waters. 
    - Right hand: Had 7 stars
    - Mouth: Sharps 2 edged sword. 
    - Face: Shining like the sun at its brightest.

17: 

John fell like a deadman at his feet and is conforted by Jesus. 
He confirms that he is Jesus because he states:
    - "I am the first and the last"
    - He lived, died, and came back to life forevermore.
    - Holds the keys of both Death and Hades.

He again tells him to write what he saw, the things that are, 
and what will happen later.

* Analysis: again, repeating this theme of past, present, and future.
Repating the origin of God's name.



20: 
The 7 stars are the 7 angels of the 7 assemblies.
The lampt stands are the assemblies themselves.


Chapter 2:

[1-7]
Ephesus: 
    - The angel reports what Jesus specifically says (the holder of the stars.)

    Summary
    + Jesus knows their works. 
    + Knows they struggled and didn't tolerate evil men
      and have tested and found false apostles. 
    + They endured for the sake of Jesus and are not tired.

    - They left their first love.
    - Calls them to repent and return to their first works.
    - If they don't he will remove their lamp stands 
        and come to them quickly.

    Specifics:
    + They hate the works of Nicolaitans (? search them up), which Jesus
        also hates. 

    ! Update (2025/4/3)
        I just looked them up and this is what I found.

        They were an early "Christian" sect that believed:
        
            - Pagan Culture: Christians could participate in Pagan practices.

            - Antinomianism: Christians were not subject to the law 
                and could indulge in sin.

            - Supported and Encouraged eating food sacrificed to Idols.

            - Encouraged sexual immorality.


    


? This ends the entry about them, yet there's specifics on what they 
did wrong, they God did describe a specicific good thing 
they did.
? I need look into this further


[8-11]
Smyrna:
    + did good works, opressed, and have poverty
    + the Jews there are false and blaspheme. 
        (Jesus calls them a synagogue of Satan)
    ! Jesus tells them not to be afraid of what 
        oppression is about to come to them. 
    ! Some will be sent to prison. They will be oppressed for 10 days. 
    ! He calls them to be faithful till death and he will give them
        the crown of life.

    !! A call to all assemblies. He who overcomes won't be harmed by the 
    seconds death.

? what exactly is the second death?

[12-17]
Pergamum:
    ? - This describes Jesus differenly! 
    It describes him by the Sword in his mouth insteado of have resurected. 

    He also emphasis that Satan dwells among them.

    + They hold firmly to Jesus name.
    + In the days of Antipas, who was killed, they didn't deny faith 
    while he was alive. 

    - there are people who hold teachings of Balaam. 
        - This taught Balak who taught Isreal to eat food 
            sacrificed to idols,
        - commit sexual immorality
        - 
    - There are people who hold beliefs of Nicolaitans as well 

    ! Repent or Jesus will come quickly with the sword of his mouth 
        to punish them.


[18-29]
Thyatira:
    Jesus description: 
        - Eyes of fire, feet of brass
    
    + Works, love, faith, service, patient endurance, 
        and each work keeps improving
    
    - They tolerate Jezebel, who seduces God's servants,
        and teached them to eat food sacrificed to idols.
    - Jesus gave her time to repent of her sexual behavior but she refuses.
    - God is going to allow her and anyone where sleeps with her 
        to undergoe oppression until they repent of her works.
        
    - God is also going to kill her children so it is known God 
        searches the heart and mind of all. 

    ~ God will will leave all who did not participate and don't know 
    what is called, 'the deeper things of satan.' he will not burden.

    He who overcomes and keeps God's work to the end will receive 
        - authority over the nations.
        - He will rule with rod of iron to shatter the them like 
            clay pots
        - something Jesus has also been given.
        - Jesus will also give them a morning star.
    
    ?? What does this realy mean?? this confuses me.

* This chapter only covers 4 of the 7  assemblies

Chapter 3

[1-5]
Sardis: 

Jesus descriptor: He who has 7 spririts of God and the 7 stars.

The assembly description: They are seen as alive but dead

- It seems they have been decaying and were about to throw out 
    the last remnant that is faithful to God.
! They need to repent and change or Jesus will come for them when they
    least expect.

+ There a few who have been faithful and they will be dressed in white
    and walk with Jesus. 

~ All who overcome the challenges of walking with God will be dress 
in white, Jesus will not remove their name from the book of life, 
and he will confess their name before the Father.

[6-12]
Philadelphia:

Jesus Descriptor: 
    - holy
    - is true
    - has the Key of David
    - opens and no one can shut
    - shuts and no one can open

+ God knows they have done good works and is opening 
    a door no one can shut

+ had little power, but kept Jesus' word and didn't deny him.

Self proclaimed Jews who are not jews = synagogue of satan

+ Those describe above will worship at their feet. 
+ Jesus says he loves them.
+ Because they were faithful, Jesus will spare them from 
    an "hour of testing" that will subject the whole world.

+ Jesus said he is coming quickly and implores them not to fail 
    before he comes.

[14-22]
Laodicea:

Jesus Desription:
    - The Amen
    - The Faithful
    - True Witness
    - The Head of God's creation

Assessment:
- Are neither hot or cold, Jesus wishes they were either.   
- Because they are neither hot or cold, Jesus will vomit them out.

Notes:
    The people here have plenty, and because they have plenty, they 
    believe they need nothing.

    Jesus's chief concern and point of anger is that they don't recognize 
    how flawed they are. 

    Jesus describes them as "Wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked."

    They are in a fallen state, and don't see it. 
    And because they don't see it, they don't reconize what Jesus 
    trully offers.

    This is what I imagine to define "Luke warm". 

    Not opposed to it, but not needing of it.


! Jesus calls them to repent and for them to buy: 
    - Gold from refined by fire.
        * What does this signify? Good works that honor God? 
            (As in storing up treasure in heaven). Compared to
            earthly wealth the deteriates.
            - Matthew 6:19-21
    - White garments to cover their nakedness
        * What does nakedness signify biblically? Their sin?
            TODO: CITE VERSE
    - eye salve so they may see.
        * See their nakedness? Their fallen state?

To Those Who overcome:
    Jesus knocks at the door and enter those who open it.

    They will sit down with Jesus as Jesus sat down with his Father 
    after he overcame.
    

Chapter 4

A door opens in heaven and invites John up there to see what 
must happen after this.

John enter the spirit and saw: 

    Main Thrown: 
        - One Sat on it
            - Looked like jasper stone and sardius
        - There was a rainbow over it (like an emerald?)
        - lightning, sounds, and thunder came from this throne.
      
    7 Lamp of fire 
        - They were burning
        - Represent the 7 spirits of God
        - In front of the throne.

    Sea of glass
        - like crystal.

    4 Creatures
        - Had many eyes in front and behind 
        - Each had 6 wings
        - filled eyes around and within
        - Have not rest constantly saying 
            "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God, the Almighty, who 
            was and who is, and who is to come!"
        1st:
            - Like a Lion
        2nd: 
            - Like Calf

            - Face of a Man
        4rth: 
            - Like an eagle    


    24 Thrones:
        - Oriented around the main throne.
        - 24 elders sat in it 
            - White Garment 
            - Gold Crowns

    When the creatures give glory. honor, and thanks to God
        - The 24 elder fall to their knees
        - worship him
        - threw their crowns before his throne.
        - They said:     
            "Worthy are you, our Lord and God, the Holy One,
            to receive the glory, the honor, and the power, 
            for created all things, and because of your desire
            they existed, and were created!"


Chapter 5

    He who sat in the main thrown(God):
        - Had a book written inside and outside 
            - Shut with 7 seals.
            - No one in earth or heaven was able to open it or look at it.
            - 

    One of the elders said not to weep, Jesus will be the one to open it 
        - Describes Jesus as 
            - The Lion of Judah
            - Root of David

    The Lamb
        - Stood amid the elders, 4 beasts, and God
        - Looked as if it was slain
        - Had 7 horns
        - 7 Eyes - The 7 spirits God sent out to the world.
        
    The Lamb took the book from God 
        - Everyone (except God) fell
            - began worshiping/praising/singing new songs
            - everyone = the 4 beasts and the 24 elders
            - Each had a harp
            - Gold bowl of incense - the prayers of the saints.
            - Sang praises about Jesus dying to save all of us
            And elivated us to kings and priests to rule the earth.

    The voice of many angles surrounded the throne.
        - Numbered 10,000 * 10,000 + 1000 * 1000 = 100,000,000,000,000
        - Said "Worthy is the lamb who has been killed to receive 
            the power, wealth, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and 
            dominion, forever and ever! Amen!"
    The 4 Creatures as said amen. 

    The elders fell down and worshipped.


Chapter 6 
    
The Lamb opened 1 of the seven seals
    - The beasts seem to be calling these guys forth with instructions
    - 1st seal -  White Horse Rider
        - Had a bow
        - A Crown was given to him
        - came conquering and to conquer
    - 2nd seal - Red Horse
        - given power to take peace from earth (kill another)
        - Given a great sword
    - 3rd seal - Black Horse

        - The 4rth beast instructed him to make the price of 
            choenix of wheat and 3 cheonix of barlet 1 danarius. 
            and not to damage the oil or wines.
    - 4rth seal - pale horse
        - Riders name is death
        - he had authority to kill 1/4th of the earth 
            by sword, famine, death, and wild animals
            ? Isnt saying death redundant?? What is og translation.
    - 5th seal - the voice of the faithful who died
        - Under they alter 
        - They plead to be avenged by God judging earth
        - They were given white robes

        - The stars fell to the earth (like fig tree dropping fruit)

        - Every human hid hemselve in caves in the mountains 
        - They plead to be hidden from the face of God and the Lamb
            and their judgment to come.

Chapter 7 

Four Angles hold back wind in the 4 corners so that
that there will be no more wind throughout earth.

An angel rose from the senset with a seal (the last remaining seal?)
telling them not to destroy earth until they 
    Seal the bondservants of our God on their foreheads.

Notes: 

    ? Who are these bondservants, and what is that term? 
    Is there a special meaning compared to regular servant? 
    ? They are being sealed on their forehead. Are they being marked 
    as belonging to God?
    ? Are they waiting for the remainder of God's people before
    destroying earth?

144,000 from every tribe of isreal were sealed.
    * 144,000 / 2 = 72,000. I thought there might be significance with 7
        but there is no meaning connection. See if this is referenced 
        anywhere.

    - Judah - 12,000 sealed 
    - Reuben - 12,000 sealed 
    - Gad - 12,000
    - Asher - 12,000
    - Naphtali - 12,000
    - Manasseh - 12,000
    - Simeon - 12,000
    - Levi - 12,000
    - Issachar - 12,000
    - Zebulun - 12,000
    - Joseph - 12,000
    - Benjamin - 12,000

After this, a huge multitude (seemingly all believers ever)
    - All languages and peopls and nations
    - Stood before the throne
    - Dressed in white
    - Palm branches
    - Cried Loudly "Salvation be to our God, who sits on the throne, 
                    and to the Lamb!"

All the angles, 24 elders, and 4 beast stood around the throne
then they all fell to their knees and worshiped God.

One of the elders asked John who these people in white robes were.

The elder answered him: They were the people who came out of 
the greate tribulation.
    ? Were they saved during it? Verse 14 seems to imply that

    ? Were Christian before the tribulation and endured it?

The served him day and night.

God ( sits in throne) will spread his tabernacle over them.
    - The will never be hungry
    - never thirsty
    - the sun won't beat them or heat
    - Jesus (the lamb) leads them to springs of waters of life
    - God wil wipe their tears


Note:
    So this isn't the opening of the last seal. 
Instead, we the starting anticipcation of it. 
The angles hold back wind and destruction until all the Christians 
are sealed. 

The ones who make it through tribulation will be before God 
and be treated deeply well by him.

Chapter 8:


7nth seal opened:
    There was a silence in heaven for 30 minutes
    
    7 angels stood before God

                Greek name is "Apollyon"
        - He opens the pit of the abyse 
            - smoke came out
            - The sun and air was darkened by it
        - Locust cameout and power was given to him
            - "as the scorpions of the earth have power"
        - Told to not hurt grass or trees or greens'
        - Only hurt people without God's seal on their forehead
            (the 144,000 still exist in this time?)
            - Could not kill, only torment them for 5 months
            - They will seek death and not find it
                - Even if they try, they cannot die.
        Locust Detail:
            - Prepared for war
            - Had golden crowns
            - Had faces like peoples faces
            - Hair like womens hair

            - Breastplates like iron
            - Sound of wings like chariots

                - it stings
                - will have power to harm men fro 5 months
            - Ruled by the king of the Abyss
            
    All this is part of the 1st woe
        - 2 More are to follow.

    6th Trumpet
        A Void came from the Golden Alter in from of God's throne
        - "Release the 4 angels bound at 
            the great river Euphrates"
    
        The 4 bounds angels
        - Bound at the Euphrates river
        - Freed to kill 1/3 of mankind
        
        Horsemen
        - Armies numbered 200,000,000
        - Those who sat on the horses
            - Wore breastplates of 
                - fiery red

                    - sulfur
                - Those 3 plagues killed 1/3 of humanity

        "For the power of horses is in their mouths, 
        and in their tails. For their are like serpents, 
        and have heads, and with them they harm." Rev 9:19

        ? Not sure what to make of this. Is it a literal desciption
        or metaphoric? If so, who is this describing? 
        The riders of the horses? The horses themselves?

        The remainder of humanithy didn't repent of their sins.
        They kepting worship idols that were just physical objects.
        Unable to see, hear, or walk.

        * This may imply reduction in tech? I mean, we have 
        robots and machines that technically see, hear, and walk.
        So either they puposefully choose to worship simple idols
        (plausible if you consider things like digital pop idols). 
        Or technology has been set back a ways at this point.

        * Eitherway, this remnent is stuck in their ways, and refuse 
        to repent or change. I wonder if they understand it 
        is wrong but do it to spite God. Or maybe they have 
        delluded themselves into think this is write like 
        we currently do.

        Their murders, sorceries, nor their sexual immorality and thefts.

Chapter 10


    An Angel Desceneded from the sky
    - clothed with a clouds
    - a rainbow on his head
    - face like the sun
    - feet like pillars of fire
    - In hand a little open book
    - right foot set in the sea
    - left foot set on the land
    - Cried with loud voice 
        - lion roars
        - seven thunders uttered their voice 
        - 
    


    John was about to write but then a voice from the sky
    said to seal what the 7 thunders said and not to write it. 
    * Interesting that this information is ommitted from us 
    the readers and only for John to know.
    ? This make me curious of who these 7 heavens could be.

    
    - The angel Lifted his right hand to the sky.
        - Swore that there will be no more delay
    - in the days of the voice of the seventh angel,
        when he's about to sound
        then, the mystery of God will be finished

        * Maybe this implies that the long discourse of if God is 
        real, what is the purpose of life, etc, will stop 
        because God will reveal everything explicitly to them?
        
        - God commands John to take the book in the angel's hand

    The angel tells John to eat the book, and that it will be 
    bitter in his stomach but sweet as honey in his mouth.

    After John ate it, the angel told John that he must 
    - Prophesy again over many 
        - people 
        - nations
        - languages
        - kings
        
    ? What does it mean for him to prophesy "again"
    
Chapter 11 

    ? Is this still under the 6th trumpet?
    ! Future me, yes this is still the 6th Trumpet 

    A rod like Reed(?) was given to John
    
    He is command to mesure:
        - God's temple
        - the alter
        - the people who worhsip in it

    He is oommanded to exclude everythig outside of the temple
        - Everythig outside of the tample has been given to
        the "nations"
        - "They" will tread for 40 days in the city

        - The 2 Witnessess 
            - will come to prophesy for 1260 days
            - Will wear sackcloth
            - They are the 2 lampstands and olive trees 
                standing before the Lord of Earth
                ? Is the mentioned in a previous passage?
            - So anyone who tries to harm them will be killed 
                by fire that comes from their mouth.
            - Not only that, anyone who tries to harm them 
                MUST DIE this way. No inbetweens or half measures.
                Toast.
            - They are given power 
                - to stop the rain while they are there.
                - to turn water to blood
                - to strike the earth plagues as much as they desire.
                    * Wow, no limits on how much plageus they can inflict
                    * maybe this is why the people of the earth rejoice
                        when they are killed.
        - Their Deaths
            - When they finish, "the beast" will fight and kill them
                * first mention I've seen of The Beast
                - It came from the Abyss

            - Their dead bodies 
                - will be in the street of great city
                    - This is city is spiritually "Sodom" and "Egypt"
                    - Where their Lord was crucified
            - People from the whole world will see the bodies
                - They see the bodies for 3.5 days
                - They rejoice and give gifts to each other
                - They were tormented by the 2 prophets
            - Then, God breaths life into them and they stand back up.
                * Parellels to Jesus resurection after 3 days.
                - Fear fell on all who saw
                - God calls them up to heaven
                - Their enemies saw them
                
        - After math
            - A great earthquacke came
            - a 1/10 of the city fell
            - 7000 died
            - the rest were terrified
            - gave glory to God in heaven
                ? They gave glory but did they repent? 
                ? Where they trying to bargain out of death?
                ? Were they saved or was it too late for them?
            - this was the 2nd woe


    THE 7TH ANGEL AND TRUMPET BLOW
        - voices from heaven said 
            "The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of 
            out Lord, and of his Christ. He wil reign forever and ever"
                    
        - 24 elders fell to their faces and worshiped God
            - saying "We give you thanks, Lord God, the Almighty,
                the one who is and who was; because you have taken
                your great power, and reigned.
                The nations were angry, and your wrath came, 
                as did the time for the dead to be judged, 
                and to give your give your bondservants the
                prophets, their reward, as well as the saints,
                and those who fear your name, to the small 
                and the great; and to destroy those who destroy
                the earth."
        
        - God's temple opened up
            - the ark the Lord's covenent was in the temple
            - lightening thunder, sounds, earthquake,
                and hail came after.

Chapter 12
        
        - A great sign was seen in heaven
            - Woman 
                - clothed with the sun
                - the moon under her feet
                - crown of 12 stars on head
                - was pregnant and about to give birth

        - Another sign
            - A great red dragon
                - 7 heads
                - 10 horns
                - each had a crown on each head
                - Tail
                    - drew 1/3 of the stars and threw them at earth.
                    

        - The dragon waited by the woman to eat her child.

        - Her Son was a boy born to rule the world with an iron rod.
        - The son went up with God to his throne
        ? Euphimism for death? Or was he literally asceneded with God
        ? Future Me Here (2025/4/3):
            Reading this again, this sounds like Jesus and Mary.
            Mary being the woman who birthed him.
            And Jesus being born to rule, 
            Dying and ascending to heaven.


        - She fled to the wilderness were God prepared a place for her
            - This place fed her 1260 days
                * ey, same amount of days as the 2 prophets
        
        - War in heaven
            - Michael and his angels battled the dragon
            - They defeated the dragon AKA the devil/Satan
            - They were thrown down to earth.

        - The Dragon Persecuted the Woman who birthed the male child.
        - The woman was given wings of an eagle 
        to flee the dragon and retreat to her place in the wilderness
        - It says she lives there for: 
        "a time, and times, and half a time"(12: 14)
            ? No idea what this means or what wording implies

        - The Earth
            - Helped the woman
            - swalled up the river the dragon threw from its mouth
        
        - The dragon 
            - Hated the woman
            - went to war against her children
                - they faithful to God's commandments
                - held Jesus' testimony

        ? So continueing with the Jesus/Mary analog, 
        is her children her literal children who became saved 
        and followed Christ?

        ? Or is it less metaphorical and instead speaking 
        here actually biological lineage?

    - This wound was healed 
    - The whole earth marveled at the beast
    - They worshipped the Dragon (Satan)

        - nation
    - The world will worship him.
    ! Verse 8 - Implies everyone who isn't saved has died?
    ? But then how does the world worship the seconds beast?
    Muse revisit this

    ! Future me (2025/4/3)
        I missunderstood this. 

        The "had been killed" part is describing Jesus (the lamb)
        and not the unsaved peoples.
        
        They are still quite alive, and unsaved.

    Second Beast
        Appearance:
        - 2 Horns like a lamb
        - spoke like a dragon
        
        - Had same authority as the first beast
        - Makes everyone worship the first beast
        - performs crazy signs like making fire rain down.
        - deceives even God's( or John's, not sure) people.
        - Make everyone on earth make an "image" of the beast
        - He gives life to the images of the Beast
            - this image kills everyone who didn't worship
        
        Mark of the Beast 
        - Given to everyone in society
        - on their hands OR foreheads
        - Cannot buy or sell w/o the mark or number of the beast
        - his number is 666
        
chapter 14
    Jesus (The Lamb) stands at Mount Zion. 
    144,000 stood with him
    - had that name of Jesus and God on their foreheads
    - have not been defiled by women (virgins)
    - Their mouth found no lie
    - They were blameless

    1st angel
    - had eternal good news to proclaim
    - Announces judgement has come


    2nd angel 
    - Announces Babylon has fallen.

    3rd angle
    - Announces all who worships and were marked by the beast 
    will also recieve wrath.
    - They will be tormented by fire and sulfer in the presence 
    of angels and Jesus.
    - Their torment will never cease
    - 

    Jesus
    - decends on a white cloud 
    - wears a golden crown 
    - holds a sharp sickle
    
    another angle (not numbered)
    - proclaims Jesus is going reap the harvest on earth
    
    Jesus reaps 

    Another angel(sickle)
    - came out of the temple in heaven
    - also a sharp sickle 

    Another angel
    - came from an alter 
    - has power over fire
    - called to the angle with the sickle to gather clusters
    of th evine of the earth b/c the earths grapes are ripe.
    
    Angel(sickle)
    - gathered the "vintage" of the earth
    - threw it into a winepress of wrath

    This winepress 
    - was trodden outside of the city
    - blood came out of it 
    - 1,600 stadia far (606 ft)

Chapter 15:
    In the sky
    7 angles bringing the 7 last plagues
    These will finish God's wrath
    * Why unleash these plagues if all the souls have already been 
    reaped and put in the winepresss of wrath
   
    Sea of glass mixed with fire
    - and those who overcame the beast stood on the sea of glass
        - held harps
        - sang the songs of moses
        - songs of the lamb worship Jesus
        
    After this, the tabernacle in heaven opened
    The 7 angels with the 7 plagues came out 
        - clothed in pure, bright, linen, and golden sashes 
        around their breasts
        - 1 of the four creatures gave the angles bowls with God wrath
    
    The temple was filled with smoke from God's glory and power

    No one was allowed to enter the temple 
    until the 7 plagues were finished
    
    
Chapter 16 

    A voice commanded the angels to pour out the 7 bowls of wrath
    
    1st; 
    - became a painful sore on the people who had the mark of the beast
    2nd:
    - poured into the sea and made it blood like that of a deadmanm
    - everything living in the seas died

    3rd:
    - poured into rivers and springs and made them blood
    - [addtional dialgoue, will add it later]
    
    4th:
    - poured on the sun
    - it scorched the people of earth with fire
    - the people in pain blasphemed the lord
    - not 1 repented

    5th:
    - poured on the throne of the beast
    - darkened the kingdom 
    - gnawed their tongues b/c of pain
    - continued to blaspheme
    - didn't repent 

    6th:
    - poured out on Euphrates and made it driedup
    - cleared so kings can make way through it on sunrise
    - from the mouth of the dragon, beast, and false prophet, 
        out came 3 uncleane spirits, demons
        - looked like frogs
        - gathered all kings together for war
        
    "Behold, I come like a thief. Bless is he who watches, 
    and keeps his clothes, so that he doesn't walk naked, and 
    they see his shame."

    * Is this jesus saying this? I believe this is a quote from 
    mathew or luke, need to go find the verse.

    All the kings were gathered at a place called "Megiddo"
    in hebrew.

    7th:
    - poured into the air
    - A loud voice said, it is done.
    - lighting, loud sounds and thunder
    - a great earthquake
        - The great city was divided into 3 parts
        - city of nations fell 
    - God gave Babylon the cup of wine of wrath 
        (I believe that was intended)
    - Island fled away (? maybe meaning sunk?)
    - Mountains dissapeared (? also maybe sunk?)
    - Hail stones fell from the sky on the people
    - they weighed the same as a talent( about 129 lbs geez)
    - The people blasphemed God because of how severe this was
    
Chapter 17

    One of the bowl bearing angels show John the Judgement 
    of "the great prostitue who sits on many waters"

    Prostitue 
    - sexual immorality with many kings
    - many on earth were made drunk by her sexual immorality 
        (may imply many beyond only kings)
    
    - She resided in the wilderness
    - A woman dressed in purple and scarlet
        - decked with gold and precious stones and pearls
        - in her hand a cup filled with abonimations 
        and impurities of sexual imorality
        - On her forehead: 
            "MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF 
            THE PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF 
            THE EARTH"
        - Drunk off the blood of the saints and martyrs of Jesus

    - Sat on a Scarlet animal
        - sat on a scarllet animal filled with blasphemous names
        - had 7 heads
        - and ten horns 
    

    Angle Breaks down here mysteries
   
    [Really confusing statemetn about the beast. Look later.]

    7 heads = 7 mountains where the woman sits

    The are 7 kings.

    5 Fallen
    1 Exists
    1 will exist in the future.

    The beast is the 8th ruler.

    The 10 horns are 10 kings 
    who have no kingdom but 
    will receive authority with the beast for 1 hour.

    10 are 1 mind and submit to the beast.

    They will war with the lamb and the lamb will overcome.

    The waters where the prostitue sat are
        the "poeples, multitudes, nations, and languages"
        basically the world.

    The 10 and the beast will hate the prostitute and:
        - make her desolate
        - make her naked
        - eat her flesh
        - and burn her completely with fire.

    The woman is a great city that rules over the kings of our world.
    


Chapter 18:
        
    An angle descends from the skies and proclaims 
    that:
     - Babylon has fallen.
     - is a habitation of demons
     - prison of all unclean spirits and hateful bird
        [?] Why hate full bird? Am I missing a reference here?

    All nations have partaken in her sexual immorality and will receive wrath

     - All kings have partook in her(Babylon's) sexual immorality
     - Merchants grew rich from here lexuries.

    The Angel calls for God's people to leave Babylon 
    so they do not partake in the sins they are doing
    (which is spirring judgement)

    The Angel calls God's people to return all that they have 
    from Babylon back, and pay double what they owe.

    The amount she glorifies herself will be as much as she
    is paid in torment and mourning.


    ! Intersting Characterization
    Babylon says she is:
    - A Queen
    - No Widow 
    - And will not see any mourning.


    ! This is interesting because she not only says she is a queen,
    but that she is no widow also. Meaning her authority is her own.
    Not one gained from inheritance nor patriarchal structure.
    
    ! It is point of Pride, so much so, that she deludes her self
    into thinking she can control destiny.

    ! I can't but help see this characterization manifest in 
    modern feminism. Not only in the extreme case but subtly 
    as well in a general sense. Like I've met people who 
    may not be as brash but still express kind of pride when
    receiving some form of authority or social elivation, or 
    desiring it with this kind of pride being the goal.

    !That's not always the case, because I have also met Christian 
    women in positions of power who express modesty and humility, 
    and enjoy it not for the autonomous power element but 
    out of desire to provide social utility.
    But it is a sentiment I've seen grow more and more 
    in media with "Women empowerment" as a prevelant pathos.


    Either way, in one day, Babylon will be receive 
    death, mourning, famine, and burned with fire as 
    part of God's judgement.


    The Kings and the Merchant will weep over her as she burns.
    
    Merchants weep because no one is buying:
        - Gold      - silver  - previous stones, 
        - pearls    - fine linen -  purple -silk
        - scarlet -all expensive wood -every vessel of ivory 
        - every vessel made of precious wood/brass/iron/marble.
        - cinnamon - incense - perfume, - frankincense - wine 
        - olive oil - fine flour - wheat - sheep - horses - chariots
        - people's bodies and souls.    
            [?] what does this mean? We talking slaves? Workers?
            Human trafficing? The inclusion of souls indicates 
            it's something beyond just physical exploitation.

    The Merchant cries for Babylon is scared to be near Babylon.

    The Angel declares she will be thrown down with great violence 
    and will be found no more.

    Further proclaimed is that she will have 
    no more of the following in her:
    - Music / Entertainment
    - Craftmen or craft 
    - Sound of a mill
    - Light of the lamp
    - voice of the Bridegroom and Bride
    
    She deceived all nations and had all the blood of the prophets/saints
    slain on earth.

Chapter 19
    
    After this, John heard a loud sound of praise over
    the judgement of Bablyon and avenging of those who were slain, 
    and the punishment for corupting the world with sexual immorality.

    A second celebration came declaring her smoke rises forever.

    24 elders and 4 creatures fell and worshiped God.
    "Halleluja!"

    A call came from the throne saying to praise God to the servants,
    big and small.

    A voice calls for praising and declares that the marriege between 
    the lamb and his wife has come.

    John is to write (by whom, idk)
    "Blessed are those who are invited to 
        the marriege supper of the lamb."
    
    They said, "This is the true words of God."

    John fell to his feet to worship but the speaker 
    says not to do that because he is only a fellow servant,
    and to instead worship God.

    The testimony of Jesus is the spririt of Prophecy.
  
    Heavene opened and someone descends.

    ! It's nice that we have full description retelling of Jesus.
    ? I wonder if there are any changes between this and 
    the initial descrption.

    Jesus Redescription:

    - Sat on a white horse.
    - called Faithful and True
    - In righteousness he judges and makes war.
    - Eyes of fire
    - on his head, many crowns.
    - He has names written and a name written no one knows 
    except him.
    - He is clothed in a garment of sprinkled in blood.
    - His name "The Word of God"
    - An army from heaven followed in white horses 
    clothed in pure fine linen
    - Out of his mouth a double-edged sword
    used to strike the nations.
    - He will rule with an iron rod.
    - "Treads the winepress of the fierceness 
    of the wrath of God, the Almighty"
        ? I Don't know what this sentence means.
    - On his garment and thigh a name witten:
    KING OF KINGS, LORD OF LORDS.
    
    An angel stood in the sun. 
    - He cried out to the birds to gather for a the great super.
    - The birds are to eat the flesh of:
        - Kings
        - Captains
        - Mighty Men
        - Horses and who sit on them
        - All men
        - free and slave
        - small and great

    The beasts and the kings of earth gathered with their 
    armies gather to face against Jesus and his army.

    The beast and the false prophet were captured and thrown
    alive into the lake of fire.

Chapter 20 
    
    An angel came down from heaven.
        - Had the key of the Abyss
        - Seized the dragon, old serpent (the devil and satan)
        - bound them for 1000 years
        - cast them into the abyss and shut it, sealed it
        - they are to stay there for 1000 years
        before they are freed again for a short time.
        
    There were people who were died for the testimoney of Jesus.
    
    Who didn't receive the mark of the beast.
    
    They ruled with Jesus for 1000 years.


    The rest of the Dead didn't live 
    until the thousand years completed.

    This is the first resurection


    After the 1000 years, Satan is released.
    He will deceive nations from all corners of the earth.
    "Gog and Magog"
    They will be gathered for war.
    
    An army the number of sand of the sea.
   
    They surrounded the "camp of the saints" and the "Beloved City" 

    God sent down a fire and devoured them.
    
    The devil was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfer
    with the beast and false prophet.

    They are tormented day and night forever.


    A great white thrown 
    - him who sat on it
        - whos face the heaven and earth fle away
        - there was no place for them.
    
    
    The dead, great and small stood before the throne.
        - They opened books
        - A book was open, the book of life
        - The dead were judged according to what was written
        in the books, according to their works.

    The sea gave up the dead who were in it.
    Death and Hades gave up the dead in them.

    They were judged according to his works(who?)

    Death and Hades where thrown into the lake of fire.

    If anyone was not written in the book of life, 
    he was thrown into the lake of fire.
    

Chapter 21

    A new Heaven and new Earth

    The first heaven and the first Earth have passed away.
    And the sea no more.
    ? Why no more sea? What is the sea?
    ? Why the need for a new heaven?

    New Jerusalem, the Holy City descends from heaven

    A voice proclaims, God's dwelling is with the people.
    God himself will be with them as their God.

    Death will be no more.
    No more mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore.

    God said he is making everything new.

    Who will be in the lake of fire:
    - Cowardly
    - unbelieving, 
    - sinners
    - abominable 
    - murderers 
    - sexually immoral
    - sorcerers
    - idolaters
    - liars

    God reiterates that this (the lake of fire)
    is the second death.

    One of the 7 angels who bore the last plagues 
    offered to show John the wife of the Lamb.

    He was taken to high mountain that oversaw 
    Jerusalem, (the holy city) descending from heaven.

    Jerusalem:
    - Her light bright and like a clear precious stone and crystal.
    (having the glory of God)
    - has great high walls
    - 12 gates
    - 12 angels at the gates
    - the names of the 12 tribes of Israel written on them.
    
    - 3 gates in each cardinal direction(N,E,W,S)
    - The walls had 12 foundations
        - had the names of the 12 apostles of Jesus on them.
        ! So there is good in honoring, writting, and remebering
        the apostles who served Christ.

    A golden reed was use to measure the city, 
    its a gates, and walls

    length = breadth = height
   
    stadia = 606.9 feet

    length = 12,012 stadia = 7,290,082.8 ft = 1380.698 miles
    The width of US is almost 2800 miles (east to west)
    
    The city is a HUGE cube.

    Wall = 144 cubits = 217.5ft
    Cubit = 1.5ft (ussual measured from one's elbow to finger tip)
    ! This may be larger because it mentions an angel measure it.
    So maybe the distance between the angel elbow to finger tip 
    is far longer.

    Walls made of Jasper
    
    City was pure gold, like glass (how?)
    Foundations of city wall were adorned with precious stones.

    First Foundation: Jasper
    2nd : Sapphire
    3rd: Chalcedony
    4rth: Emerald
    5th: Sardonyx
    6th: Sardius
    7th: Chrysolite
    8th Beryl
    9th: Topaz
    10th: Chrysoprasus
    11th: Jacinth
    12th: amethyst
    

    12 gates were twelve pearls 
    Each of the gates were made of one pearl.
    
    The streets of the city were pure gold, 
    (again) like transparent glass

    (verse 22)
    I saw no temple in it because the Lord God, the Almighty,
    and the Lamb, are its temple.
    
    ? Interesting a list of 3 nouns, but it doesn't mention
    the holy spirit. Interesting the it John make the effort 
    to list 3 items, but those 3 entities don't perfectly 
    correspond to the trinity we know (father, son, holy spirit)
    This requires further investigation into other titles 
    used to describe the holy spirit and other translations of this.

    The city needs no sun or moon. 
    God illuminates the City.
    And Jesus, the Lamp, is the lamb.

    The nations will walk in its light.
    
    Kings bring the glory and honor of nations into it 
    (city or light?)

    The gates will never be shut
    
    Nothing that profane or can cause abominations can enter it.
    Only those written in the book of life can enter.


Chapter 22 
    River:
    - water of life
    - clear as crystal
    - proceeding from the throne of God and the Lamb
    - in the middle of the street
    - Tree of life on this and that side of it
        - Bore 12 fruits
        - yielded every month
        - leave were for healing nations
        
    - There will be no curse no more
    - Throne of God and Lamb will be in it
    - His servant will serve him
    - They will see his face 
    - His name on their foreheads
    - There will be no night b/c God illuminates them
    - They reign forever
    

    Speaker said to John that these words are true 
    and God sent his servant to reveal what must happen soon.

    John fell to worhsip the angel messanger 
    but the messanger said no because he is also just a servant.
    
    Let be continue as they are, allow:
        The unjust to be unjust
        filthy be filthy still
        righteous to do righteousness still
        holy to be holy still
 
    Jesus will come quickly
    Reward is with him
    to pay each man to his work
    
    Alpha and Omega
    First and Last
    Beginning and End
    
    Blessed are those who keep his commandments
    they may have right to the tree of life and enter city
    
    Outside are:
    - the dogs
    - sorcerers
    - sexually immoral
    - murderers
    - idolaters
    - everyone who loves and practices falsehoods
    
    Jesus sent the angel to testify these things

    for the assemblies (chruches)

    The root of David, the Morning Star
    
    The Sprite and Bride (church) yell "Come"
    And allow all who are thirsty and desire 
    to go and receive water of life.


    The text says any who remove and add text to this book
    will be removed from the book of life.

    [These are private notes not ment to substitute the bible.]

    ! Something Weird! In the web version of using, these verses
    are cut off. There's an aditional verse 20 and 21 in the NIV 
    version of using. Weird but also scary if this is not a 
    problem in my program but part of the actual translation.
    
    ! Just checked and the KJV does indeed 
    include those final verses.

    The NIV version finishes with Jesus saying 
    "Yes, I am coming soon."
    
    And amen and suplication for Jesus to return.
    
    The grace of the lord be with his people.

    And a final Amen.
