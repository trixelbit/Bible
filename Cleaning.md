I'm compiliing what the bible says about cleaning. 
Though this is spawned from a desire for inspiration for my game,
I do find interest in understanding the bible depiction of cleaning
and what meaning can be derived from it.



Examples: 

What: Jesus cleaning the feet of his disciples
Where: John 13 : 1-17 

Analysis:
    So some context, Jesus is aware that his time is running short.
    The devil started putting into motion Judas's betrayal.
    And its pointed out that not only his Jessus cam from the Father
    and is going to return to him, but that he loved those in this 
    world, till the very end.
    
    I'm not sure if he specifically his disciples, 
    of this specfically extended tot the whole world.

    But Jesus choose to reflect this by washing the feet of his 
    disciples Peter.
    
    Peter initially rejects, but Jesus said if doesn't get washed
    he doesn't belong to him.

    Then he goes the opposite end, asking to not only 
    having his feet cleaned but his hands and head too. 

    But Jesus said he is clean, just not all of him is clean.



    So the act of cleaning Jesus performs is an act of claiming what 
    is his.
    Or maybe cleaning to elevate those to the required cleanliness
    needed to be part of him.


    Interesting that he cleans Peter at his dirtiness level.
    He doesn't clean what is already clean.

    Of course, this can be seen metaphorically, 
    his Act of cleaning representing what he is about to 
    do on the cross for all of the world, 
    which reinforced the idea of him loving the people in 
    the world to the end.
