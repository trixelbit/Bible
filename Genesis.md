# Remarks

My working progress through Genesis.
Largely just summary with observations, questions, and alalysis through out.


## Chapter 1


### Day 1
God created Heaven and Earth is Created

Earth in this state:
- Formless
- void 
- Darkness was upon the face of the dep  ? What does this mean?

? I wonder what the original hebrew for these meant and what the connotations are.

In this state, [The Spirit of God] moved across the waters.


God Created Light
God saw the light was good.
God divided the light from the darkness.



He called light Day and the darkness Night. 
That evening and the morning where the first day.

~ I used the read the big bang in metaphorical terms for potentially bigger events like the big bang. However, the language used here feels too literal.And if we use the "Let there be light" as the big bang, then the earth still predates it based on the ordering described here which I'm sure are chronolgical.

### Day 2

God created 'Firmament' in the waters and allowed it to divide waters from waters.



? I'm really not familier with the word firmament. Even the google defintion doesn't provide insight to me on this. I may need to look at the original untranslated word and search from there.

~ The more I look at different translation as well as what comes after.
This seems to implies earth as a spherical object didn't exist yet, but rather
everything was very mangled in mist of sorts. 
The action performed here(I think) actually separates everything out intro discrete groups.
