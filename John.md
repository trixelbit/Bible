## 1


"In the beginning was the Word, 
and the Word was with God, 
and the Word was God."

~  I believe I've seen analysis that say "Word" is referenceing to Jesus.
It's intersting that the W in word is capitalized signifying a proper Noun.


"The same was in the beginning with God.
All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made."

? I'm unsure if this is refering specific to God the father or the Word(Jesus)
Or if this significance doesn't matter seeing that they are one.
If it describes Jesus, then it's interesting seeing the creatiopn element/role 
associated with him since I ussualy think of his redemptive/restoring actions 
performed in the gospel.

"In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not."

? Again, the language makes me think it refers to Jesus since he is the one 
who  entered the world (the darkness) to give new life.
And the pharisees could not comprehend him.
Though I still want to look whether Jesus is who is refered to be "Word"



The next passage describes John the baptist who was not the light,
but instead was intended to be a witness the "Light".

In this case, the true light is Jesus.


"He (the true light aka Jesus) was in the world, 
and the world was made by him, 
and the world knew him not."

~ This seems to confirm and attach that creation role the Jesus as well.
Though again, it could be refering the God is a whole. 
At the same time though, Jesus is the specific person of God that entered the world
so I believe this is indeed refering to him specifically.


Those that believed in him where given the power to become 
the sons of God.

"Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, 
nor of the will of man, but of God."


~ So this inclusion into being children isn't by:
    - Blood - meaning were didn't simply inherit it by relation I'm guessing?
    - Flesh - not be the will of our flesh. Maybe just signifying body.
    - Will of men - not by concious choice I believe?
    ! Need to look into this because that would have some strong implications.
    But will isn't neccessarily cognition. It can mean a more fundimantal thing.
    Like an internal posture or nature that was can't just will.

But of God. Meaning God's will is what draws us in, which signifies a sort of 
determinism at a glance. 
! Look at what calvinist and armenianist say about this verse (John 1:13).
