I'm reading through Ezekiel at 1:04 am.

And I found this chapter that is interesting. 

It is Chapter 18.


It describes how the individual is accountable for sin. 

It describes a ritous man who obeys the laws of God.
And says he will live.

Then it describes his son who is the opposite and sins in every way. 
The Word says he will Die. 

Then a describes the son of the unrighteous man. 
His son does not sin despite the actions of the father. 

Then the Word clarifies that the son will live, 
and that the sin of the father does not affect. 


Then the Word goes forward to say that not only will the righteous man live
and the unrighteous die. 

But also that people who are in sin repent and turn from it, 
they will live. 

And likewise, that the righteous who fall into sin will die. 

This chapter concludes by highlighting how God does not 
delight in the death of the wicked. 
And called for the Israelites to leave the sin 
and importantly, to put on a new heart and spirit. 
And that they will be judges by their individual actions.


## Points of critical thought

Verse 22 says that none of the things they did will be remembered. 
Because of the righteous deeds, they will live. 


This is such big thing for me because the main thing emphasised 
in the gospel is they salvation is not bought by good deeds or works 
but rather by faith in Jesus. 

But Salvation produces good works.

The importance of Jesus is further emphasised by the idea that 
humanity had fallen short of God's standard that even our good 
deeds are like filthy rags. That our good works could not save
us. 

So this verse struck me by how much it seemingly it promotes 
this works based salvation, at least on a surface level.

This shouldn't be a shocker since there's much of the new testament 
that on the surface seems to have that tone.

But what is often reitirated is that the actions are 
preceded by an internal change. And that God ultimately 
desires for everyone's salvation and does not delight 
in the "death" of the wicked.

And even the conclusion of this chapter is call to action 
for the people of Israel to change their "hearts" and "spirit".

In fact, the more I read verse 21 through 25, 
the more this seems to subvert my initial works based reading
and instead echo themes of the Gospel.

In works based system, there would be this moral bank "balance",
where all negative and positive actions are summed up. 
And then, the difference ultimately determines your state. 

But here, that's thrown out. 

A person who turns from sin, the verse 
states all past misdeeds will be discarded. 

    "None of the offenses they have committed will be 
    remembered against them. Because of the righteous 
    things they have done, they will live." Ezek 18:22

Inversely, the person who did good but turns to sin, 
non of their goods will matter:

    "But if a righteous peson turns from their 
    righteousnesss and commits sin  and does the 
    same detestable things the wicked person does, 
    will they live?
    None of the righteous things that person has
    done will be remembered." Ezek 18:24

So notice, there's not summation. 
Weight per actions, good or bad, previously done.

Rather, the most important state is the current.
And notice, how it's not focused on the specific 
sins, but rather the state of the heart.

A theme Jesus emphasized in the Gospels.
How that law wasn't meant as a game 
to play legal technicalities with
or something to use a weapon against others, 

but rather as a mirror that revealed the state
of our hearts.

This passage called for the people of Israel 
the put on a new heart and spirit. 

Jesus called for the world to be born again.

## More Context after more reading.

I completely neglected the start of the Chapter
which add important framing for this.

This Chapter begins with God telling the people 
of Israel to stopping saying specific proverb.

"The Fathers have eaten sour grapes, 
and the children's teeth are on edge"

In essence, the people of Israel are saying that the 
blame for their current circumstances is due to 
the sins of their fathers.

This is not a surpising thing since part of the old covenant 
was that sin of the father could extend multiple 
generations.

But God say this is no the case. 
The people of Israel can not use that as excuse because 
each of them are accountable for their own actions.
Not their fathers. 
This chapter highlights the individuals so much 
because it's making a point to show 
each person is accountable for their own actions.

This also sets the stage for the Gospel since 
what Jesus emphasizes is that not only are 
we accountable for our own sins, but by our 
own works we fail and fall short. 

### New Questions
This makes me ask new questions now though. 
Where these people part of the new covenant, 
even though they were before the time of Jesus?
Like humanity had already been racking up a tab 
that he eventually paid?
But then there are things that are diffent after 
his resurection, like him sending the Holy Spirit 
onto earth. 

It's late right now but this is really interesting.



## Questions that need answering for better analysis

What does the writer mean by death and life? 
And ultimately, what does God mean?

Is it death and life in the bodily sense? 
Or is it death and life in a spiritual, after death sense? 


How does this passage read across different translations?
